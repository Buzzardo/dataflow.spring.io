# Developer guides

There are several guides in this section, but a common starting path through them consists of the following steps

- Follow the Getting Started guide which shows you how to use the [prebuilt applications](%currentPath%/concepts/app-starters/) to create and deploy a Task using Data Flow.  
  This gives you a quick feel for how to use the Dashboard to create a stream, deploy it, and look at the logs.

- Develop your own Task with Spring Cloud Task, deploy it manually to a platform, and dive into what is happening on the platform.

- Take the Task application just developed and register it with Data Flow and then deploy it to the platform.
