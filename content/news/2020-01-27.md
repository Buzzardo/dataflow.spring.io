This is a maintenance release for small bug fixes, enhancements, and dependency updates. Generally speaking, we'are now on Spring Cloud Hoxton SR1. List of fixed issues can be found from [2.3.1 Issue List](https://github.com/spring-cloud/spring-cloud-dataflow/issues/3707).

## Maven Preemptive Authentication

Support for using Maven Wagon transport for HTTP has been added to the Maven Artifact Resolver infrastructure. The driver for this was a request from a user to be able to use preemptive authentication with JFrog’s artifactory. Use of it is currently optional via a property but we’re looking to make it default sometime in the future and possibly introduce more wagon transports which might provide interesting options to place your artifacts behind ssh, git or whatever Apache Wagon is able to provide.
